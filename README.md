# Word-Guess_Game

Football (aka Soccer) - the world's game, 'the beautiful game' as some call it.  This Word Guess Game is a tribute to 'the beautiful game' and, in particular, the greatest league in the world - the English Premier League.

There are 20 teams in the English Premier League, some with some fairly unusual names.  Your job is to guess them, by selecting letters 'hangman'-style.  If you do, you will be rewarded with each team's emblem, and your score will climb. Every letter you guess will count for you; every letter you get wrong will be a goal for the computer.

The computer's feeling kind - it will allow you 10 (TEN) incorrect guesses.  Get the right answer before then, you win that round of the game.  Fail to guess the team, and the computer will tell you what the answer was, but your total score will stay the same.

Particular features of the code include:

1. The computer randomly selects a team
2. Having calculated the length of the team's name, it displays the blanks on the screen; blanks [between words] are taken care of for you
3. With every key-stroke from the player, the computer indicates a correct guess by filling in the blank - and incrementing the player's score.  Multiple occurrences of a single letter are displayed - it's only fair...
4. For incorrect guesses, those are shown at the bottom of the screen, and the computer scores a point.  If the computer scores 10 points, it wins that round
5. Don't worry about capitals vs. lower case - the computer takes care of that, both in reading and then also writing to the screen
6. Don't worry about hitting a number or character key - only letters are counted; the computer takes care of that
7. Also, don't worry about guessing the same letter twice - the computer knows what you have guessed before, and will not allow multiple guesses of the same letter
8. No one wants to play the same team over and over again - the computer keeps track of which teams you have played, and will not repeat one until all teams have been chosen
9. Finally, the reward.  If you do guess the funny name of the small English town, the computer will display the correct image of the team's emblem
10. With every team you guess, you are invited to play again.  The game-scores are cleared, but you total score remains until you refresh the page.  Therefore you can count how many you got right.

Good luck, play well and keep it clean!
